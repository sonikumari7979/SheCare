This website is a kind of replica of tinder, containing a beautiful UI implemented using HTML5, CSS3 and BOOTSTRAP5, I've used some advanced CSS properties like CSS Z index stacking, media query breakpoint, in additional to that I have also added carousels and cards . Go and have a look at the website and share your feedbacks.
